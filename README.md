# Automation of the Play Store and App Store listings for the new Open Food Facts mobile app (Smoothie) with Fastlane

See also the Smoothie main repository: https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app



### Metadata upload
Once it works, the results should be visible on the stores for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.app) and [iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/smooth-app/id1526747703), and eventually on the main listing (org.openfoodfacts.scanner)

### Screenshot wrapping (deprecated)
Screenshot wrapping adds texts and wrapping to raw screenshots. It currently does that automatically, and uploads as artefact
