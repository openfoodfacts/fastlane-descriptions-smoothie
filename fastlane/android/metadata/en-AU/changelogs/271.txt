The Open Food Facts project turns 10 ! We've created a completely new version of the app to celebrate.
New features of the week:
* You can scroll for more search results, without button clicking
* It's easier to navigate in the app settings
* We're actively working on the scan issues for Redmi, Xiaomi and other devices
We look forward to hearing your feedback about this update at contact@openfoodfacts.org
