Open Food Facts is a non-profit project to open food data from around the world. Join us on https://en.openfoodfacts.org

Scan the barcode of food products to know which products are good for you (nutritional quality: Nutri-Score, NOVA group, additives and allergen alerts) and the planet (Eco-Score)!
