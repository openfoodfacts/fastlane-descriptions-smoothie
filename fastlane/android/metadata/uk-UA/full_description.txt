News: We invented the collaborative scanning app in 2012. ü§≥ü•´ As we turn 10, we‚Äôre reinventing it from the ground up!

This app lets you find food that's good for you and good for the planet by scanning their barcodes.
You will get personalized health & eco-impact info for 2.3M foods.

<h1>üëâ  Set your food preferences without ruining your privacy</h1>
<h1>üëâ  A scan that truly matches who you are</h1>

<h1>üëâ Contribute to Food Transparency</h1>

‚ûú Open Food Facts is made by everyone, for everyone!
‚ûú In short, we're "the Wikipedia of food", as the press nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has also enabled the creation of over 150+ apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.
‚ûú Use it to make better food choices
‚ûú The app is also collaborative. If the product is missing, contribute pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score, food processing level (NOVA) & Eco-Score.
‚ûú Make a difference today by photographing a product from your kitchen.
‚ûú Open Food Facts is a non-profit project made by thousands of volunteers from around the world. Why don't you join us ?

<h1>üëâ Decipher food labels</h1>

We decipher products labels for you. You'll find:
‚ûú Nutrition: The Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat, transfat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein, salt & sodium.
‚ûú Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
‚ûú Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
‚ûú On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.

<h1>üëâ Our grades are science-based, and Open Food Facts is helping science!</h1>
