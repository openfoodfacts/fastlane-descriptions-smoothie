<h1>▶ Scan, find & compare more than 3 million food products</h1>
The app allows to scan the 3 million products already contained in the free and open database Open Food Facts.
The app is collaborative. If we don't have the product, you can add pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score and NOVA score on food processing.

In short, we're kind of "the Wikipedia of food", as many have nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has enabled the creation of over 100 apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.
