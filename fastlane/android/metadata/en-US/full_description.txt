<h1>▶ Scan, find & compare more than 1,3 million food products</h1>
The app allows to scan the 1,3 million products already contained in the free and open database Open Food Facts.
The app is collaborative. If we don't have the product, you can add pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score and NOVA score on food processing.

In short, we're kind of "the Wikipedia of food", as many have nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has enabled the creation of over 100 apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.

<h1>▶ Decipher food labels</h1>

➜ Open Food Facts helps you decipher products labels. You will be able to find:
➜ carbon footprint (CO2 emissions) and packaging (as well as recycling instructions),
➜ Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat / fat content, saturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein and salt and sodium.
➜ brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher ...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins of ingredients)
➜ On wines and beers, you will find the alcohol content.

<h1>▶ Our grades are science-based, and the project is helping science back!</h1>
➜ We don't make up things. We rely on peer-reviewed science.
➜ The Nutri-Score has been created by the independent French team led by Professor Hercberg.
➜ The NOVA groups on food processing have been designed by the international team of Professor Monteiro.
➜ The additives synthesis is based on reviews by EFSA on exposure levels on food additives.
➜ The Open Food Facts community is collaborating with research teams across the planet to improve nutrition research that benefits all.
