Open Food Facts. We invented the collaborative scanning app in 2012. 🤳🥫 As we turn 10, we’re reinventing it from the ground up, and this time, it’s personal. 

<h1>👉  Set your food preferences without ruining your privacy</h1>
<h1>👉  A scan that truly matches who you are</h1>
✅ Green: the product matches your criteria
🛑 Red: there is a problem
⬜️ Gray: Help us answer you by photographing the products
<h1>👉  Compare in 15 seconds the 3 brands of tomato sauces left on the shelf.</h1>
<h1>👉  Get a tailored comparison of any food category</h1>

== Criteria you can pick == 
🌍 Environment
⚕️ Health
🏭 Additives & Ultra processed foods
🧂 Salt
🌾 Allergens
Nutri-Score
Eco-Score

<h1>▶ Scan, find & compare more than 2,3 million food products</h1>

Scan more than 2,3 million products already contained in the Open Food Facts collaborative database.
The app is also collaborative. If we don't have the product, you can contribute pictures and data to get the Nutri-Score, NOVA groupe on food processing and Eco-Score.

In short, we're kind of "the Wikipedia of food", as many have nicknamed the project. Open Food Facts has enabled the creation of over 150+ apps like Date Limite, Yuka or FoodVisor.

➜ Nutrition: Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat / fat content, saturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein and salt and sodium.
➜ Environment: Ecoscore, carbon footprint (CO2 emissions) and packaging (as well as recycling instructions), recyclability of packages, labels (organic, quality etc.), where the ingredients come from
➜ Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher ...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins of ingredients)
➜ On wines and beers, you will find the alcohol content.

<h1>▶ Our grades are science-based, and the project is helping science back!</h1>
➜ We don't make up things. We rely on peer-reviewed science.
➜ The Nutri-Score has been created by the independent French team led by Professor Hercberg.
➜ The NOVA groups on food processing have been designed by the international team of Professor Monteiro.
➜ The additives synthesis is based on reviews by EFSA on exposure levels on food additives.
➜ The Eco-Score is based on ground breaking data by ADEME, the French environmental agency, adapted for the world.
➜ The Open Food Facts community is collaborating with research teams across the planet to improve nutrition research that benefits all.
