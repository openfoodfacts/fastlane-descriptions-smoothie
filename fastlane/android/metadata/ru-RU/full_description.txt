We decipher products labels for you. You'll find:
➜ Nutrition: The Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat, transfat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein, salt & sodium.
➜ Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
➜ Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
➜ On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.

<h1>👉 Our grades are science-based, and Open Food Facts is helping science!</h1>
➜ Мы ничего не выдумываем. Мы полагаемся на проверенные научные исследования.
➜ Оценка Nutri-Score была создана независимой французской командой, возглавляемой профессором Херцбергом.
➜ Группы обработки продуктов питания NOVA были разработаны международной командой профессора Монтейро.
