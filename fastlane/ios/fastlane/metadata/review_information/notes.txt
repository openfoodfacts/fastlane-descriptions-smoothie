Thank you for reviewing the Open Food Facts app. This is a collaborative, free and open database of food products from around the world. The app allows users to scan barcodes and view product information.

For testing purposes, you can scan any food product barcode to see how the app works. The app does not require an account for basic functionality, but users can optionally create an account to contribute product information.
