Decipher food labels

We decipher products labels for you. You'll find:
- Nutrition: The Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat, transfat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein, salt & sodium.
- Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
- Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
- On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.

Our grades are science-based, and Open Food Facts is helping science!
- We don't make up things. We rely on peer-reviewed science.
- The Nutri-Score has been created by the independent French team led by Professor Hercberg.
- The NOVA groups on food processing have been designed by the international team of Professor Monteiro.
- The additives synthesis is based on reviews by EFSA on exposure levels on food additives.
- The Eco-Score is based on ground breaking data by ADEME, the French environmental agency, adapted for the world.
- The Open Food Facts community is collaborating with research teams across the planet for research that benefits all.

Your food, your data. Privacy-friendly app.
