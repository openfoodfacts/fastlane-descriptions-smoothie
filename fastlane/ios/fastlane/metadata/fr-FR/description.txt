We invented the collaborative scanning app in 2012. As we turn 10, we’re reinventing it from the ground up!

This app lets you find food that's good for you and good for the planet by scanning their barcodes.
You will get personalized health & eco-impact info for 2.3M foods.

Decipher food labels

We decipher products labels for you. You'll find:
- Nutrition: The Nutriscore (nutritional score), nutrients, fat, transfat, carbohydrates, sugars, fiber, protein, salt & sodium.
- Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
- Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
- On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.
