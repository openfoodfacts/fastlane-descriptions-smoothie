- Environment: The Ecoscore (including carbon footprint (CO2 emissions), packaging (as well as recycling instructions), environmental labels (organic, quality etc.), and origins of ingredients)
- Other: brands, allergens, labels (bio, gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, halal, kosher...), traceability information (packaging codes, origins, food factories)
- On wines and beers, you'll find the alcohol content.
